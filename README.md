This is an extension project to the replicazeron repository by [9R](https://github.com/9R/replicazeron/tree/main). 

I wanted a custom made PCB to allow for easier wiring. 
Once I have built mine, I will update this doc with a BOM of parts that you will need. 

I opted for SMT Diodes due to space reasons.
